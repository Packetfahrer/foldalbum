FoldMusic.
by Ariel Aouizerate & theiostream.

##### About
FoldMusic is a MobileSubstrate extension for iOS which allows you to create folders on the homescreen like the icon folders, which contain instead of icons, a list of songs.

The folders are created by users in a preference panel and can be formed from either an album or from a playlist.

##### On open-source
Even though this is a paid product sold for $1.5 dollars in the Cydia Store, I decided to dare the standard model of how tweaks are distributed and see if I will manage to get any contributors to this project (that's quite needed!)

This software is licensed under the zlib license (see below), which I guess covers this software's rights nicely. Please respect it (or at least read it).

##### Compiling
1. Delete $THEOS/include/MediaPlayer or set those up right. Go for the second option.
2. make

ANY warnings in this project is due to a difference in my environment from yours. Please do not submit patches which ONLY adapt this project to your header set. If you had to do any changes like such to be able to compile, I will accept the patch but WILL modify the source to be compilable in my environment.

##### Contributing
I gladly take extensively tested patches to FoldMusic in the form of a pull request. Although, if you find yourself in a situation where your patch must be distributed in the form of another package, the following instructions must be followed:

1. Do not in any way release or sell a minorly altered patch to this project.
2. Make it clear it is based on work by the original authors without endorsing purposes.
3. Change the name and the bundle identifier of this project and make it conflict with the original package.

IF THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT FOLLOWED I *WILL* TERMINATE THIS PROJECT.
